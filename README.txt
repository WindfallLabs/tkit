Tkit is a user interface creation toolkit for executable Python scripts.
Although flexible, this package takes an out-of-the-box approach to GUI/TUI providing
predefined components.

gui.py (TODO: rename tkit.py to gui.py) contains the Tkinter- and ttk-based GUI-creation tools.
tui.py (WIP) will contain Unicurses-based TUI-creation tools.
consolemsgs.py contains functions for writing colored messages to the console.
