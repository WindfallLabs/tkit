====================
Tkit -- Tool-toolkit
====================

Tkit is a toolkit for creating GUI and CLI script tools with Python.
It's goal is to simplify tool creation, and provide easy-to-use Tkinter objects and nice shell messages.
Specifically, this package is designed for scripts which are executed by double-clicking.

Notice: tkit.cli is the only fully-functional submodule in this package. Others are WIP.
