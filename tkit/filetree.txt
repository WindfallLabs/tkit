Branch: filetree
filetree edits were made, committed and merged

new edits in this branch are on the browse_entry module
	added BrowseDir class
	renamed BrowseEntry class to BrowseFile
	updated all docstrings to """Docstring message.""";
		section labels were left as the """ Section name """ format

moving forward:
	rename tkit to wftkit
	change the __init__.py to import widget classes from individual modules
		e.g.:

import wftkit

app class stuff
...
self.browse_file = wftkit.BrowseFile(self)
...
self.radiobox = wftkit.Radiobox(self)
